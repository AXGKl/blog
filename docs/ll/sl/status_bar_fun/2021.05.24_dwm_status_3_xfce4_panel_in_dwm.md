# The XFCE4 Panel in dwm

## Achievements

- We completely switched off dwm's systray patch and set the status bar to a constant empty string => cpu problem solved.

- Then we got XFCE4's panel to work, instead:

State changeable and saved:  
![][p2]

Plugins work:  
![][p1]

Fading out when not hovered:  
![][p3]

A lot of plugins out of the box:
![][p4]

Plus all 3rd party systray aware apps work.


## How did we do it

### Starting it

We use the autostart patch - but xinit and the likes would also work.

Here we configured in `autostart.sh` of dwm to run this:

```bash
~ ❯ cat bin/panel.sh
#xfce4-session NEVER EVER DO THIS IN DWM!
xfce4-panel --disable-wm-check
```

The panel was then shown and we moved it to the right place with the mouse.

Then we required a few hacks in dwm to get it working like a real statusbar.

### Rules in config.h

Declaratively it is possible to have it shown on all tags like this:

```C
static const Rule rules[] = {
    /* class                  instance    title       tags mask   , iscentered,    isfloating,     monitor */
    { "Xfce4-panel",          NULL,       NULL,       (1 << 9) - 1,     0,                0,           -1 },
```

The `(1 << 9) - 1` sets a 1 on all 9 tags.

But what you get is not yet really behaving like a status bar
- The window has the same thick border like all others
- All tags hint an active application on them in the tag bar
- The window, at every redraw, is being offset by dwm to reside below the status bar


### Some imperative changes

Lets fix that in `dwm.c`, matching on the name of the panel:

```

## Along the way: A Neat WM Test Setup, Using Xephyr

Having to restart the WM after any change sucks. Especially when it crashes the usual restart loop turns ugly.

So I looked a bit around and found this: There is an X application which behaves as a normal X client -  but offers
a full X Display environment inside(!): xnest. Check it out: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xephyr


So with 

```bash
~ ❯ cat bin/xnest
#!/usr/bin/env bash
Xephyr -br -ac -noreset -screen 1100x1000 :1 &
sleep 1
DISPLAY=:1 "${1:-dwm}"
```

we get an instantly starting dwm build of our liking, started within a normal X11 window :-)

![][p7]


When you hit `ctrl-shift` with it focussed it grabs *all* your mouse and keyboard events - even the parent's dwm
hotkeys - which I find pretty remarkable. No need to redeclare all your hotkeys within your test builds, so that they do
not collide with your 'real' window manager's ones.
> This is something which makes testing of WM builds fare more convenient than with e.g. docker or VNC window rooted builds.

Only downside is that the inner WM is running in the same filesystem, if you not re-root it, i.e. when you set e.g. your
wallpaper, it will behave exactly like the outside one - setting it. No isolation, clear. But ideal for our purpose.
