# AXGK's [Blog](https://axgkl.github.io/blog/)

- Just some random [collection](https://axgkl.github.io/blog/) of software related stuff - and a
  testbed to try a thing or two...

- For my own private purposes, not yet worth sharing

- May turn into a 'real' tech blog some day

- May also turn into my memoires. Really not yet sure, how much fun I'll find in typing markdown..
